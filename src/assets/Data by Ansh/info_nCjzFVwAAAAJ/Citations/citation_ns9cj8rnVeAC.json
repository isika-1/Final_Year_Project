    "description": "The most basic method of experimentation using data mining algorithms is the command prompt. A convenient approach of interactive graphical user interfaces can be supplied for data exploration to build up complex studies. A graphical user interface gives an upgraded status for experimental data mining. An innovative proposal for employing data mining methodology on biodiversity data is shown in this article through the KDB (Knowledge Discovery in Biodiversity). It provides a platform for domain researchers to apply their datasets to domain-specific data mining algorithms for further analysis. A convenient interactive graphical user interface is provided for data exploration for the biodiversity domain to build up complex studies. The proposed data mining methods are developed in Java, while the website is built in PHP.",
