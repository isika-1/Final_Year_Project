    "description": "The efficient discovery of frequent itemsets from a transaction database is the fundamental step for association rule mining in data analytics. Interesting associations among the items present in a transaction database contribute to knowledge enrichment. Thus, decision-making and pattern generation from the massive amounts of data become effortless. But one of the major problems associated with the algorithms of frequent itemset mining is excessive memory requirements, which cause them to be inappropriate for larger datasets with itemsets having high cardinality. A few novel data structures for mining frequent itemsets have been introduced in recent years. For example, N-List, NodeSet, DiffNodeSet, proximity list, etc. have been proposed that show a coherent mining approach for improving the execution time while still leaving the scope for further improvements in memory requirements. In this paper, we â€¦",
