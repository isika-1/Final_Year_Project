    "description": "Nandy, Biswadeep DebMondal, Kartick ChandraRecently, Self Organizing Networks (SONs), have been immensely researched. SON solutions must become the brains of the 5G Network. 5G has been envisaged to deploy in above 6 GHz mostly in 28 GHz or above. Beam-forming will be used to mitigate coverage loss due to high propagation loss. Line of sight communication is a must for above 28 GHz operations thereby presenting severe challenges in maintaining UE connection. Optimizing coverage and capacity are the major requirements of operators. The main hindrance in achieving optimized coverage and capacity is the complexity of adjusting all the configuration parameters which are affecting them. Most of the existing solutions are based on 4G and currently, very few solutions have been proposed for 5G considering line of sight operations above 6 GHz. Here, firstly we identify the challenges which …",
