    "description": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Type 1 (HIV-1) which is the etiologic agent of AIDS, has been the centre of attention of virologists in recent times due to its life-threatening nature and epidemic spread throughout the globe. The virus infects the host cells for replication by exploiting a complex interaction network of HIV-1 and human proteins and causes destruction of the power of human immune system, gradually leading to death. Antiviral drugs are designed to utilize the information on viral-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs), so that the viral replication and infection can be prevented. Therefore, the prediction of novel interactions based on experimentally validated interactions, that are curated in public PPI database could help in discovering new therapeutic targets. In this article, an overview of HIV-1 proteins and their role in virus replication and pathogenesis has been given followed by a discussion on different types of antiretroviral drugs and HIV-1-human PPI database. Thereafter, we have presented a brief explanation of different approaches adopted to predict new PPI and their predicted results along with the overlap of predicted interactions by different literatures.",
