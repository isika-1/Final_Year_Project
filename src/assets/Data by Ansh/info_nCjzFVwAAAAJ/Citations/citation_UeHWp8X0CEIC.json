    "description": "Pattern extraction is one of the major topics in the Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD) and Background Knowledge Integration (BKI) research domains. Extracting patterns from databases, data warehouses and other kinds of data repositories is one of the most unyielding tasks. Extensively, it is subsumed as a part of the data mining task. Out of numerous data mining techniques, association rule mining and bi-clustering are two major complementary data mining tasks for relevant knowledge extraction and integration. These tasks gained much importance in many research domains in recent years. However, to the best of our knowledge, no approach was proposed to perform these two tasks in one process. In this thesis work, we propose an original approach for extracting different categories of knowledge patterns while using minimum number of resources. These patterns, based on frequent closed sets and supporting object lists, are used to construct conceptual minimal representations of association rules, bi-clusters and classification rules. They extend the classical frameworks of association and classification rules, and of bi-clusters, by providing the user with more information using the object lists associated with these patterns. These patterns are generated from the sets of generators, or key-patterns, the sets of closed patterns and the hierarchical conceptual structure induced from generators, closed patterns and supporting object lists. The proposed approach, named FIST for Frequent Itemset mining using Suffix-Trees, is based on a new suffix-tree data structure that enables the efficient storage of data and computation of relevant patterns …",
