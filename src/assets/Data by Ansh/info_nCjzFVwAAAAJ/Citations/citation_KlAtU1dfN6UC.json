    "description": "Data mining is a fundamental ingredient for making association rules among the largest variety of itemsets. Rare pattern mining is extremely useful judgment to generate the unknown, hidden, unusual pattern, using predefined minimum support confidence constraint from transactional datasets. Rare association rule is related to rare items that represent useful knowledge. Mining rare patterns from those database is more interesting rather than frequent pattern mining. In this paper, we presents the taxonomy of different support constraint model for rare pattern mining. Also we have performed a comprehensive literature review on existing tree based rare pattern mining algorithms. Finally, we have proposed a multiple item support constraint based dynamic rare pattern tree approaches that only generates rare itemset without considering frequent itemsets generation.",
