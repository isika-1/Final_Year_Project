    "description": "Chandra Mondal, KartickChakraborty, TanikaMukhopadhyay, SomnathPropositionalization is a promising approach for effectively handling dataset in the field of knowledge discovery. It is the most important part of data mining. Knowledge discovery always motivates data summarization when structured and unstructured datasets are stored in a large database system. Propositionalization leads from relational data and background knowledge to a single table representation. This table is the input to the widespread systems for knowledge discovery. This paper presents different approaches like logical and database-oriented propositional logic in a formal way. Logic-based propositionalization depends on background knowledge of the dataset moreover that is a single relational database. This paper explained relational subgroup discovery (RSD) and relational features (RelF) as a logic-based approach. For both …",
