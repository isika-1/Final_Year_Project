    "description": "The threats of extinction and loss of diversity of Himalayan medicinal plants have been accelerated since decades due to global climate change associated with anthropogenic pressure. Such a flora, Taxus wallichina is facing regional extinction due to over-exploitation for its superb utility in various medicinal and non-medicinal trading purposes. The assessment of the impact of climate change on the suitability of ecological habitats of this climate-sensitive species is of utmost importance. The new generation climate model, CMIP6, provides us with different plausible future climatic scenarios driven by shared socio-economic pathways for different future periods. Through the implementation of ensemble speciesâ€™ distribution modelling, we assess the probabilistic niche distribution of Taxus wallichina under current and different future climatic scenarios. A precise wide-range spatial-temporal assessment of suitable niche distribution leads us to the identification of potential regions for conservation of the species to facilitate their sustainability. A detailed time frame estimation in the niche distribution assists the identification of any retrieval or consistent declination in habitat suitability of a particular zone. The target species featuring its potential distribution in the zones of ample precipitation and cooler monsoon is observed to show drastically different range-shifts under different projection pathways. The present study reveals that the habitat suitability assessment should be carried out time to time under all possible socio-economic projection pathways to update the conservation policies in future.",
