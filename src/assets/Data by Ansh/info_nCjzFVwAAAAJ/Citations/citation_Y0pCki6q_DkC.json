    "description": "Microarray experiments generate a large amount of data which is used to discover the genetic background of diseases and to know the characteristics of genes. Clustering the tissue samples according to their co-expressed behavior and characteristics is an important tool for partitioning the dataset. Finding the clusters of a given dataset is a difficult task. This task of clustering is even more difficult when we try to find the rank of each gene, which is known as Gene Ranking, according to their abilities to distinguish different classes of samples. In the literature, many algorithms are available for sample clustering and gene ranking or selection, separately. A few algorithms are also available for simultaneous clustering and feature selection. In this article, we have proposed a new approach for clustering the samples and ranking the genes, simultaneously. A novel encoding technique for the chromosomes is …",
