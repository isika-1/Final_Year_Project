    "description": "Flood is one of the major natural calamity often strikes the state of West Bengal, India, during monsoon. With rapid ongoing human activities in the river basin regions, the effect of flood on human society becomes matter of panic day by day. The analysis of flood hazards and assessing potential vulnerable areas along with level of vulnerability is very much essential for proper disaster risk assessment and management of the region. Remote sensing and GIS platforms can be considered very handy for analysing of the flood mapping, risk monitoring, hazard analysis, and disaster management planning. In this study, flood-inundated area was obtained in GIS platform by taking contour pattern of the area developed from DEM imagery, river gauge height at normal and peak flow condition as input layers. This model can further be used for flood prediction and identification of the vulnerable area. The risk …",
