    "description": "Instabilities at the deformable free surface of a thin nematic liquid crystal film can develop interesting patterns when exposed to an external electrostatic field. A general linear stability analysis is performed involving the Ericksen–Leslie governing equations for the dynamics of the nematic film coupled with the anisotropic Maxwell stresses for the electric field to uncover the salient features of these instabilities. The study reveals the coexistence of twin instability modes: (i) long-wave interfacial mode – stimulated when the sole destabilizing influence of the electric field overcomes the Frank bulk elasticity and surface tension force, and (ii) finite-wavenumber mode – engendered by the combined destabilizing influence originating from the anisotropic electric field and Ericksen stress, for the films with positive dielectric anisotropy and weaker Frank bulk elasticity. The results reported here are in contrast with the same …",
