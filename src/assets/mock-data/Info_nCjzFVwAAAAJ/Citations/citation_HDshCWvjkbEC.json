    "description": "TV White Spectrum utilization has become a major concern in the field of communication sector throughout the world. This research paper focuses on utilizing the TV White Spectrum for Wireless Broadband Internet Connectivity (WBIC) on the basis of availability. For reference, a practical scenario has been considered. The scenario represents the TV White Spectrum of Bangladesh Television (National Television Channel of Bangladesh) and utilizes the unused bandwidth for Wireless Broadband Internet Connectivity (WBIC). Bangladesh government has allocated 56 MHz of Bandwidth among 200GHz of total bandwidth for communication purposes of Bangladesh for BTV (Bangladesh Television) broadcasting. But, BTV is using only 6 MHz of the available 50MHz frequency. So, the rest of the 50 MHz frequency remains unused. This paper, explains how this unused 50 MHz frequency can be used for Wireless Broadband Internet Connectivity (WBIC). This paper also considers a case of using 6 MHz frequency for Sangsad Television (A live broadcasting TV Channel of Parliamentary Sessions). On the basis of availability of these two Television Channel (BTV and Sangsad TV) White TV Spectrum of 56 MHz have been explained and proposed. In this research a proposed model has been designed to use the unused bandwidth and simulation result proves that higher data rate can be achieved by using this white TV spectrum.",
