    "description": "Climate-change driven sea level rise causes a increase in salinity in coastal wetlands accelerating the alteration of the species composition. It triggers the gradual extinction of species, particularly the mangrove population which is intolerant of excessive salinity. Thus despite being crucial to a wide range of ecosystem services, mangroves have been identified as a vulnerable coastal biome. Hence restoration strategy of mangroves is undergoing rigorous research and experiments in literature at an interdisciplinary level. From a data-driven perspective, analysis of mangrove occurrence data could be the key to comprehend and predict mangrove behavior along different environmental parameters, and it could be important in formulating management strategy for mangrove rehabilitation and restoration. As salt marshes are the natural salt-accumulating halophytes, mitigating excessive salinity could be achieved by â€¦",
