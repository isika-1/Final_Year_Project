    "description": "Three-dimensional data is becoming more prevalent these days. Unsupervised data analysis can be used to find hypothesized patterns of interest from the three-dimensional data. In this context, clustering can be used to group observations along a single dimension, but its usage is restricted in three-dimensional data domains as the observations are significantly connected in subspaces of the overall space. Bi-clustering addresses the issue of subspace clustering but ignores the third dimension. As a result, the concept of tri-clustering, coherent subspaces within three-dimensional data, was introduced. To deal with these issues, tri-clustering, the identification of coherent subspaces within three-dimensional data, has been extensively studied. Despite the wide range of contributions to this topic, there is still room for improvement in terms of a more structured view of tri-clustering, extracting multiple forms (e.g., row â€¦",
