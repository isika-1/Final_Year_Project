    "description": "Self-organized interfacial instabilities of an ultrathin bilayer confined between a pair of rigid surfaces is explored. The bilayers are classified based on the macroscopic dewetting behaviors of the liquid films sandwiched between a pair of confining surfaces having surface energy higher or lower than the liquid films. Linear and nonlinear analyses employing the governing equations originating from the continuum description together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations unveil the salient spatiotemporal features of the dewetting process. The study uncovers that, under the destabilizing influence of the intermolecular interactions, the interface of a confined bilayer can deform into interesting embedded and encapsulated patterns with nanoscale periodicity. The continuum and MD simulations collectively show the detailed route to dewetting starting from the formation of holes in the early stage, their growth to â€¦",
