    "description": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) has grabbed the attention of virologists in recent times owing to its life-threatening nature and epidemic spread throughout the globe. The virus exploits a complex interaction network of HIV-1 and human proteins for replication, and causes destruction to the human immunity power. Antiviral drugs are designed to utilise the information on viral-host Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs), so that the viral replication and infection can be prevented. Therefore, the prediction of novel interactions based on experimentally validated interactions, curated in the public PPI database, could help in discovering new therapeutic targets. This article gives an overview of HIV-1 proteins and their role in virus-replication followed by a discussion on different types of antiretroviral drugs and HIV-1-human PPI database. Thereafter, we have presented a brief explanation of different …",
