    "description": "Transitions from spinodal to pattern-guided dewetting of a bilayer of ultrathin films (<10 nm) confined between a pair of patterned surfaces have been explored employing molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The physical or chemical defects of different sizes and shapes are decorated on the confining substrates by either removal or addition of multiple layers of similar or dissimilar atoms. The simulations are performed to identify the transition from spinodal pathway to the heterogeneous nucleation route, with the variation in the size of the substrate patterns. The MD simulations reveal the limits beyond which the defects can guide the dewetting to generate ordered patterns of nanoscopic size and periodicity. Comparing the results obtained from the MD simulations with the more widely employed continuum dynamics approach highlights the importance of the MD approach in quantitatively analyzing the dynamics of â€¦",
