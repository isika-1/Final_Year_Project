    "description": "This disclosure provides systems and methods for robotic task planning when a complex task instruction is provided in natural language. Conventionally robotic task planning relies on a single task or multiple independent or serialized tasks in the task instruction. Alternatively, constraints on space of linguistic variations, ambiguity and complexity of the language may be imposed. In the present disclosure, firstly dependencies between multiple tasks are identified. The tasks are then ordered such that a dependent task is always scheduled for planning after a task it is dependent upon. Moreover, repeated tasks are masked. Thus, resolving task dependencies and ordering dependencies, a complex instruction with multiple interdependent tasks in natural language facilitates generation of a viable task execution plan. Systems and methods of the present disclosure finds application in human-robot interactions.",
