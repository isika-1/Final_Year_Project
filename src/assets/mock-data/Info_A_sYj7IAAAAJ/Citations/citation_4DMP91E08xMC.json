    "description": "Green Information and Communication Technology (G-ICT) is an emerging area of research and development and the major factor pertaining to this area is energy efficient designs for IT systems. Data mining deals with a special class of algorithms which are centered towards predicting and modeling patterns and trends in huge volume of digital data. Has anyone thought of the situation where data processing needs will surpass the energy production of the world? This is really going to happen if we don't start taking appropriate steps from now onwards. One of the most sought after solution is trading of accuracy of results with current consumption efficiency and good latency which is generally known as inexact or approximate computing. In this regard, we have applied some approximation techniques which can be used to achieve energy efficient data mining or Green Data mining with results as best as possible for …",
