    "description": "This disclosure relates to system and method for enabling a robot to perceive and detect socially interacting groups. Various known systems have limited accuracy due to prevalent rule-driven methods. In case of few data-driven learning methods, they lack datasets with varied conditions of light, occlusion, and backgrounds. The disclosed method and system detect the formation of a social group of people, or, f-formation in real-time in a given scene. The system also detects outliers in the process, ie, people who are visible but not part of the interacting group. This plays a key role in correct f-formation detection in a real-life crowded environment. Additionally, when a collocated robot plans to join the group it has to detect a pose for itself along with detecting the formation. Thus, the system provides the approach angle for the robot, which can help it to determine the final pose in a socially acceptable manner.",
